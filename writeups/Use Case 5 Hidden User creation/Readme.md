# Hidden User Creation

 Hidden user creation techniques are methods used to establish user accounts that are not readily visible in the user interface or standard user management tools. This can be done for various reasons, including security, persistence, or evading detection

## Objective

Detection of hidden user creation is crucial for identifying unauthorized access attempts.  
It helps reveal attacker tactics like persistence and privilege escalation.  
Left undetected, such accounts can enable long-term system compromise.
